# Quantum-Machine-Learning
Quantum Machine Learning–based framework for early Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis using multiple QML algorithms simulated with PennyLane and integrated with IBM Qiskit for quantum circuit modeling.

## 📌 Project Description

This project explores the application of **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)** algorithms for the **early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease**, focusing on leveraging quantum computational principles to enhance classification performance on neuroimaging-derived features. Multiple QML models are implemented and evaluated to analyze their effectiveness in identifying early-stage Alzheimer’s patterns.

The quantum circuits and hybrid quantum–classical learning pipelines are simulated using **PennyLane**, enabling seamless integration of quantum nodes with classical machine learning frameworks. Additionally, **IBM Qiskit** is utilized for quantum circuit construction and backend compatibility, allowing experimentation with quantum gate operations and kernel-based learning approaches.

The study emphasizes comparative evaluation of different QML algorithms, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and suitability for medical diagnostic tasks under noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) constraints. This work demonstrates the feasibility of quantum-assisted learning for healthcare applications and provides a foundation for future deployment on real quantum hardware.
